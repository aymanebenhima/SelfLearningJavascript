### Exercise: Count the number of vowels in a string

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `countVowels` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input string is "hello world", the expected result should be:
```
The number of vowels in the string "hello world" is 3.
```
If the input string is "javascript is awesome", the expected result should be:
```
The number of vowels in the string "javascript is awesome" is 8.
```

#### Hints:
1. Iterate through each character in the string.
2. Check if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) using conditional statements or regular expressions.
3. Keep track of the count of vowels found.
4. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is a string.
- Allow the user to input the string using prompts.
- Test the function with different input strings to verify its correctness.
