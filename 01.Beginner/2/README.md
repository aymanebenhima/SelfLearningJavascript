### Exercise: Calculate the sum of two numbers

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript program that calculates the sum of two numbers.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the two numbers are 3 and 5, the expected result should be:
```
The sum of 3 and 5 is 8.
```

#### Hints:
1. Use variables to store the two numbers you want to add.
2. Use the addition operator (`+`) to calculate the sum of the two numbers.
3. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input values are numbers.
- Allow the user to input the two numbers using prompts.
- Create a function that takes two parameters (the two numbers) and returns the sum.
