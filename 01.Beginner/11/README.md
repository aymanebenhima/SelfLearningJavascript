### Exercise: Find the sum of all numbers in a given array

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `sumOfArray` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all numbers in the array.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input array is `[3, 7, 2, 9, 4]`, the expected result should be:
```
The sum of all numbers in the array [3, 7, 2, 9, 4] is 25.
```
If the input array is `[15, 27, 10, 35, 20, 45]`, the expected result should be:
```
The sum of all numbers in the array [15, 27, 10, 35, 20, 45] is 152.
```

#### Hints:
1. Initialize a variable to store the sum of numbers, initially set to 0.
2. Iterate through the array and add each number to the sum.
3. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is an array of numbers.
- Allow the user to input the array using prompts.
- Test the function with different input arrays to verify its correctness.
