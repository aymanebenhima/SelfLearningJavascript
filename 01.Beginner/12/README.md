### Exercise: Check if a given number is a palindrome

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `isPalindrome` that takes a number as input and returns `true` if it's a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input number is 121, the expected result should be:
```
121 is a palindrome.
```
If the input number is 12345, the expected result should be:
```
12345 is not a palindrome.
```

#### Hints:
1. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.
2. Convert the number to a string and compare it with its reverse.
3. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is a number.
- Allow the user to input the number using prompts.
- Test the function with different input numbers to verify its correctness.
