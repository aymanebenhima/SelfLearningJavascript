### Exercise: Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion

#### Task:
Write a JavaScript function named `calculateFactorial` that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns its factorial using recursion.

#### Expected Result:
For example, if the input number is 5, the expected result should be:
```
The factorial of 5 is 120.
```
If the input number is 0, the expected result should be:
```
The factorial of 0 is 1.
```

#### Hints:
1. The factorial of a non-negative integer n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
2. Use a base case to handle the termination condition (e.g., if the input number is 0 or 1, return 1).
3. Use recursion to calculate the factorial of the given number by multiplying it with the factorial of the previous number.
4. Use `console.log()` to display the result.

#### Additional Tasks (Optional):
- Add validation to ensure that the input value is a non-negative integer.
- Allow the user to input the number using prompts.
- Test the function with different input numbers to verify its correctness.

```JS
const calculateFactorial = (n) => {
    if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
            return 1;
    }
        else {
            return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
        }
    }
    
    
    console.log(calculateFactorial(5))

```
