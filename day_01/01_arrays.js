### Exercise: Level 3

- The following is an array of 10 students' ages:

```js
const ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]
```

  - Find the median age (one middle item or two middle items divided by two)
  - Find the average age (sum of all items divided by number of items)
  - Find the range of the ages (max minus min)
  - Compare the value of `(min - average)` and `(max - average)`, use `abs()` method

- Slice the first ten countries from the `countries` array
- Find the middle country(ies) in the `countries` array
- Divide the `countries` array into two equal arrays if it is even. If `countries` array is not even, one more country should be in the first half.
